/*
 * This program implements a simple loop through a small linked list, but it
 * is broken.  When you try to compile this file using the provided Makefile,
 * you will see several errors that say something like "incomplete type" or
 * "incomplete definition of type".  This happens because the linked list
 * is implemented in such a way as not to expose its inner implementation
 * details.  In this recitation exercise, you'll explore how to fix this
 * broken loop without exposing the implementation details of the list.
